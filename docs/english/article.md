### The role of light in reading and writing

```
if you are writing or studying, 
it make very much difference where We light comes form.
People who use books and pens every day have to be especially carefull about the way the light shines on their work.

Every house gets its light either from daylight through the windows-which is the best to use-or from lamps or electricity;
but whichever kind of light it is, 
the way it shines towrd our book or work is a matter of great importance to the eyes.

Take a book.
sit with your back toward the window,
and try to read.
Your shadow falls all over the page and makes it almost as bad for your eyes as if you were in a dark room.

Now turn around and face the window.
The page is in the shadow again,
while the bright light is in your eyes..

Try sitting with your right side toward the window.
This is very well for reading.
but if you were writing.
the shadow of your hand would fall across the page and bother you a little.

There is just one other way: 
sit with your left side to the window.
Now everything is perfect for reading and for writing, too.

Whatever kind of light is in the room,
the rule about the right to sit is always the same.

> `the right of sth.`是指某种具体的权力，即后面的`of sth.`是定语，起修饰限定作用，所以of后面跟的应该是某种权力的名称；
而 `the right to sth.`是指拥有针对某物的某种权力，后面跟的是某种物品，而这种物品很明显不可能是一种权力。
